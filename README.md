My undying gratitude to [Udacity](Udacity.com) for providing...well pretty much everything: The game engine, the resources, the css, the html, and of course, the online lessons to teach me how to fill in the blanks in `app.js`. And on behalf of 80% of the people on the forums, thank you for the sleepless nights, bouts of impostor syndrome, and for my bald head, because I tore all my hair out trying to finish this one.
